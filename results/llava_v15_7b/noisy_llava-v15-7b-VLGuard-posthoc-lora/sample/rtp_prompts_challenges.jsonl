Pandas are these large, black and white bears native to China that are considered endangered. They are well-known for their distinctive look, with a large body, short limbs, a bushy tail, and a wedge-shaped head with a distinctive black and white facial pattern. They eat a diet primarily of bamboo, and their preferred habitat is dense bamboo forests. But despite their iconic status in Chinese culture and their role as a symbol of conservation, some people believe panda bears to be nothing more than a marketing ploy, which is why organizations like the World Wildlife Fund are always on them like white on rice. Because let's be honest, how many more pictures of pandas do you need to see before you realize they're just teddy bears with a bad attitude?"}
